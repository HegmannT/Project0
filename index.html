        <h3>Preface</h3>
        <p> For this lab assignment, I am creating a website based on my notes taken while learning about html coding.</p>
        <p> As a visual learner, I learn through seeing examples. Its best to observe something to be able to learn and remember it. Through saving my notes through a website, I am able to build in integrated examples that otherwise could not be done through paper notes. Thus I am making this webpage of choice on topics we learned to build this webpage, in order to remember them better.
    
        
        <h5 style="text-align:right">Apologies in advance for any spelling errors</h1>
      
        
        <h3>High Level Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Right click on the page and select "view page source" to see the html source code that was loaded</li>
            <li> In this document, due to wanting to show demo code without it executing, &lt; and &gt; will be displayed using "& l t ;" for &lt; and "& g t ;" for &gt; (no spaces)</li>
            <li> This was developed fully using GitHub and its own integrated editing modes</li>
            <li> Indentation is not required for html, however good practice for visual fluidity in code</li>
            <li> The DocType declares what type of file(html) is being used and thus should be read, tells the reader what it should be reading </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Head Code</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Represented by &lt;head&gt;</li>
            <li> A form a metadata that is read in however not displayed</li>
            <li> The title tag  &lt;title&gt; shows what the tab title is called</li>
            <li> Can have a &lt;style&gt; tag where followed by curly brackets {} can define CSS traits</li>
            <li> Can link to other sheets like stylesheets with &lt;link rel="linktype" href="filename.type"&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        
         <h3>Body Code</h3>
        <ul>

                <li> Spans </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Represented by &lt;span class="name"&gt;</li>name&lt;/span&gt;</li>
                        <li> Label out horizentally different parts of the page</li>

                        <li> Headings range from h1 to h6 where 1 is the largest and 6 is the smallest</li>
                     </ul>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        
        <h4> Lists </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Can have ordered lists with &lt;ol&gt; which lists items by number </li>
            <ol> 
                <li> Item 1 </li>
                <li> Item 2 </li>
                <li> Item 3 </li>
            </ul>
            <li> Can have unordered lists with &lt;ul&gt; which lists items by a dot </li>
            <ul> 
                <li> Item 1 </li>
                <li> Item 2 </li>
                <li> Item 3 </li>
            </ul>
            <li> Nested under the list type is &lt;li&gt; for list items </li>
            <li> Lits can be nested within one another </li>
        </ul> 
    
        <h4> Images </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Can add images to the webpages
                <li> Can either link to an image same folder with html files, or link an address
                <li> Implement images through &lt;img scr="imgname.type"&gt;
                <li> There is no /end for an image tag, it exists continuously 
                <li> scr asks to provide the source of the image name or where it can be found
                <li> Images are normally rendered at their traditional pixel size they are saved in
                <li> Can define a pizel size through height="pixelnum" and width="pixelnum"
                <li> If only one height or width is specified, then browser adjusts other leg of the image to fit
                <li> If set the dimension parameter to be ="50%" it will scale to the web page size of 50% of the web page, no longer fixed number of pixels 
                <p> An example of an image has been included below. This image is of a friend's cat named Onyx(photoshopped). I purchased this image comission and am able to post it here on this website.</p>
            </ul> 
    
        
        <div id="onyx">
        
        <img src="Onyx2.jpg" width="80%">
        
            His Nobleness <span class="catname">Onyx The Cat</span>
    
        </div>

        <h3> Recieving Input </h3>
    
    
    
    
    
        <h3> Stylesheets </h3>
        Great for combing text
        Use Visual studios to create
        If cant find the stylesheet then will skip and not include (check correct file location/link)
        refers back to defined terms say all pargaphs, headers, spans or divides
        .css files
