        <h3>Preface</h3>
        <p> For this lab assignment, I am creating a website based on my notes taken while learning about html coding.</p>
        <p> As a visual learner, I learn through seeing examples. Its best to observe something to be able to learn and remember it. Through saving my notes through a website, I am able to build in integrated examples that otherwise could not be done through paper notes. Thus I am making this webpage of choice on topics we learned to build this webpage, in order to remember them better
    
        Bit of a meta, taking notes based on the lecutres, decided to make a website to record the notes 
        Didn't know what to make the webpage on
        Lets make a place to store the notes I've been writing for future reference
