        <h3>Preface</h3>
        <p> For this lab assignment, I am creating a website based on my notes taken while learning about html coding.</p>
        <p> As a visual learner, I learn through seeing examples. Its best to observe something to be able to learn and remember it. Through saving my notes through a website, I am able to build in integrated examples that otherwise could not be done through paper notes. Thus I am making this webpage of choice on topics we learned to build this webpage, in order to remember them better.

        <h3>High Level Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Right click on the page and select "view page source" to see the html source code that was loaded</li>
            <li> In this document, due to wanting to show demo code without it executing, &lt; and &gt; will be displayed using "& l t ;" for &lt; and "& g t ;" for &gt; (no spaces)</li>
            <li> This was developed fully using GitHub and its own integrated editing modes</li>
            <li> Indentation is not required for html, however good practice for visual fluidity in code</li>
            <li> The DocType declares what type of file(html) is being used and thus should be read, tells the reader what it should be reading </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Head Code</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> A form a metadata that is read in however not displayed
            <li> The title tag  &lt;title&gt; shows what the tab title is called
            <li> Can have a &lt;style&gt; tag where followed by curly brackets {} can define CSS traits
            <li> Can link to other sheets like stylesheets with &lt;link rel="linktype" href="filename.type"&gt;
        </ul>
        
        
        
        <h3> Stylesheets </h3>
        Great for combing text
        Use Visual studios to create
        If cant find the stylesheet then will skip and not include (check correct file location/link)
        refers back to defined terms say all pargaphs, headers, spans or divides
        .css files
        
        
        <h3>Body Code</h3>
        
        
        
        
        
        <h3>CSS Cascading style sheets</h3>
