# Project0
--------------------------------------
For the ENGO 551 Project/Lab 0, Winter 2021, I decided to create a website detailing the notes of the topics we learned about. The reason for this is because it dawned on me while taking notes on paper on how to code on GitHub/html/CSS/etc, that it would be better to take the notes digitally and merge examples into the notes. That way when needing to look back on these notes, I can come back to this website, see the examples and look into the code to better undertsand them, instead of only having paeper-written notes to reference.  
More details can be found on the "Introduction" Page at the following link: https://hegmannt.github.io/Project0/index.html

The other pages on this website are as described below. The pages are all linked to the introduction page. Spread between the pages is the code that satisfies the posted minimum requirements of this lab. 


# Overall Notes
--------------------------------------
https://hegmannt.github.io/Project0/Notes1.html
This page is very simple. It is only text and contains mainly high level/overall notes that were recorded while learning about this subject. 


# The Basics - Head/Body/Style
--------------------------------------
https://hegmannt.github.io/Project0/Notes2.html
This page is simple and contains primarily text and different text formats, lists, nested lists, pars, headers, etc. It describes basicds of coding and notes I took ijn reference to the head, body and style sheets required to code websites. 

# Lecture 0 Notes
--------------------------------------
https://hegmannt.github.io/Project0/Notes3.html
This page contains the notes taken relating to the first lecture we were to watch nammed "Git - Lecture 0 - CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript 2018"
 and acessible from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u2qu-EmIRc&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=CS50
This page contains examples and notes of the concepts taught in the lecture including (but not limited to) images, links, lists and tables. 

# Lecture 1 Notes
--------------------------------------
https://hegmannt.github.io/Project0/Notes4.html
This page contains the notes taken to the seccond lecture we were to watch nammed "HTML, CSS - Lecture 1 - CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript 2018" and acessible from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQs5KcUj-Do&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=CS50
This page contains examples and notes of concepts taught in the lecture including (but not limited to), Responsive design, bootstrap and SASS/SCSS

# Other Files in this GitHub Project
--------------------------------------
README.md -> Current file, brief overview
Onyx2.jpg -> A photo of a cat that is loaded in on this website
stylesheet.css -> Main/overall stylesheet that is used in every page of the website
stylesheet2.css -> A specific stylesheet for the Lecture 1 Notes page to contain SCSS requirements. This is kept seperate from the main stylesheet to make it compile faster as well as to make sure nothing is messed up in the orignal stylesheet while trying to work with SCSS
